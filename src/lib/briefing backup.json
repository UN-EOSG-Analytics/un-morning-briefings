  "entry": "<ul><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Convened by:</strong> Laura Flores, Director of the Americas Division, DPPA, UN Coordinator for Venezuela&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;<strong>Context:</strong> This coordination role was established following the decision of the Extraordinary EC on 5 January.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Purpose of the Meeting: </strong>To review the current political and humanitarian situation in Venezuela and coordinate UN system engagement in light of ongoing developments.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Coordination Group on Venezuela (CGV)</strong> was established following the 5 January meeting of the Executive Committee, which decided that DPPA would designate a senior official at the D2 level to coordinate UN cross-pillar action in Venezuela, to pave the way for an inclusive political transition, in close consultation with the Resident Coordinator and UNCT. DPPA designated the Americas Division Director to play this coordinating role. The Group will serve as the principal Headquarters mechanism for UN inter-departmental and inter-agency coordination of strategic guidance and information exchange on the situation in Venezuela. It will also monitor the political, security, humanitarian, development and human rights situation in Venezuela; exchange analysis, identify UN priorities and make recommendations for strategic engagement. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Meeting minutes:</strong>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <strong>Director of the Americas Division (AD)</strong> shared that the Secretary-General has offered his good offices to support an inclusive political process, which is critical to healing divisions among Venezuelans and achieving lasting stability. To that end, he held meetings with the Permanent Representative of Venezuela and of the United States. The Permanent Representative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela invited the Secretary-General to visit the country. The Secretary-General has accepted the invitation but has designated DPPA to represent him. DPPA will coordinate the visit of a technical mission led by a senior official. AD stressed that the Secretary-General is not considering a Personal Envoy at this moment, and the exchanges within the Group will also inform aspects of the visit and future engagement. AD recalled that the Secretary-General has underscored, the gravity of the situation in Venezuela and called a coherent, system-wide UN response, emphasizing that the UN must remain consistent with its principles and play a constructive role. He also called for full alignment across all pillars to prioritize humanitarian and operational continuity, strengthen human rights protection, promote peacebuilding, and, eventually, ensure technical readiness for credible elections, reaffirming that the UN\u2019s guiding principle is to support Venezuelans in shaping their own future while safeguarding the Organization\u2019s neutrality and integrity. The Secretary-General has also noted that resource mobilization should remain needs-based and low-profile to avoid perceptions of political alignment. The focus should remain on humanitarian continuity, recovery projects, and support to local communities.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regarding the situation in Venezuela, AD highlighted that acting President Rodr\u00edguez has moved quickly to normalize state functions and project continuity after the US operation. She has signaled guarded readiness to engage with Washington and has started a \u201cdiplomatic exploratory process\u201d with the United States to re-establish diplomatic representations in both capitals, while aiming to balance internal political tensions. Initial senior government appointments have signaled continuity. While there is being progress in the release of detainees, from 800 political prisoners according to human rights groups, only about 60 appear to have been released thus far. AD briefly described the US three-phase plan (stabilization, recovery, and transition) and uncensored that credible elections would require reforms, including in electoral bodies and the judiciary, as well as political agreements.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; The Resident Coordinator </strong>provided an overview of the evolving situation on the ground, underscoring the delicate balance in the relationship between the government and the US. He highlighted the recent meeting of the Acting President with EU Member States, the UK and Switzerland, as a sign of openness, as well as the attitude of Minister of Interior, who has aimed to display alignment with acting President. Despite the ongoing liberation of detainees, precautionary measures in place, structural challenges remain, and foreign correspondents are no allowed to access to the country. The authorities continue to communicate that their priority remain the liberation of President Maduro, continued negotiations with the US and political and security control of the territory. The RC stressed that the State of Emergency, which entered into force on 5 January, is not being fully implemented, as this would significantly undermine the free movement of UN operations across the country and across the borders. For the UN, support to the social agenda, human rights and institutionalization remain key priorities. He stressed that it is the moment to push for OHCHR's return. Regarding upcoming missions to the country, the RC called for a sequenced and strategic approach, with the SG-delegated mission coming first, and requested the alignment of communication engagement, with harmonized UN messaging and calls.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Human Rights:</strong> OHCHR highlighted High Commissioner T\u00fcrk\u2019s involvement on the Venezuela issue and stressed that the situation offers an opportunity to reaffirm the centrality of human rights. OHCHR regretted that prisoner releases have been conditional, with those released not able to speak publicly, and underscored that pressure continue for the continuation of releases, without conditions. Emergency measures and longer-term institutional reforms as well as the protection of civic space must prioritized according to OHCHR, as vital for the transition. OHCHR announced that HC T\u00fcrk has requested to speak with HC has requested to speak to President Rodriguez. The DHC met with the Venezuelan Permanent Representative in Geneva and OHCHR seek to engage further and will continue advocating for the return of the team to Venezuela. A technical human rights mission could follow the DPPA visit, which should also address the human rights situation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Migration:</strong> UNHCR addressed the human mobility angle and reported no movements in border crossing to Colombia and Brazil. The most likely scenario is continued forced returns from the US and Latin American countries. The change in government in Chile was mentioned as an example which may trigger additional non-voluntary returns. UNHCR highlighted that funding remains an issue. Potential US financial support to humanitarian operations through OCHA should be explored. UNHCR also called for the Group\u2019s support in advocating to address visa restrictions undermining humanitarian operations. IOM also participated and underscored closed coordination with UNHCR. DCO called for close consultations with RCs across the region, to ensure a common regional approach on human mobility&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Humanitarian access:</strong> UNICEF reported increased controls and discretionary administrative practices in states bordering Colombia and Caracas, as well as arbitrary detentions and subsequent release of adolescence. OCHA underscored the importance of ensuring continuity of the humanitarian response and reported no confirmation of additional US humanitarian funding. The RC stressed that the Working group on access continues to monitor the situation and has not identified obstacles compromising humanitarian access. On existing obstacles in the obtention of visas for humanitarian workers, the RC acknowledged that the backlog continues but there are expectations of improvement.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>International Financial Institutions:</strong> As highlighted by the EC decision, engagement with IFIs, once political conditions allow, could be an avenue to reinforce institution-building, governance reforms, and anti-corruption safeguards. Cooperation with IFIs was described as critical by the RC, following 15 years of absence of the World Bank from the country. It was agreed that the UN should engage with IFIs in the definition of their strategies to support reconstruction once conditions allow. PBSO offered to liaise with IFIs in this process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Peacebuilding: </strong>support through PBF, despite limited resources, could be explored if UN requirements were met.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Development: </strong>DCO offered to deploy surge capacity if needed, as well as to mobilize the RCP capacities to support UN engagement in Venezuela.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Communications: </strong>as media interest on the matter gradually decreases, the Spokesperson\u2019s office offered to host the RC as a noon briefing guest to highlight the humanitarian and development needs in the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Electoral support: </strong>EAD highlighted that significant institutional and legal aspects must be addressed ahead of an electoral process \u2013 the 2024 Panel of Experts Report, available internally for consultation, features useful recommendations. Changing the composition of the CNE and the Supreme Court were mentioned as examples of significant reforms which would also send a powerful political message.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Drugs and crime: </strong>UNODC highlighted that cooperation will continue to be overseen by their office in Colombia. Coordination with the RC is ongoing for a potential technical level mission, particularly relevant as anti-drug policies will remain at the top of the political agenda and a priority for the US engagement in the country.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>UN neutrality: </strong>OLA underscored the need to remain neutral and avoid any form of engagement which may appear to be legitimizing the US intervention, which, as stated by the Secretary-General did not comply with international law.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Next steps:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The RC highlighted that the current context poses an opportunity to foster intra-Venezuelan dialogue and push for reforms that can lead to a transition. This will require identifying meaningful spaces for UN engagement, including through in-country missions, as well as continued engagement with national stakeholders and key external ones, including T\u00fcrkiye, Qatar, Brazil, or Colombia. Direct engagement of the Secretary-General with the Venezuelan authorities was also mentioned as a potential enabler ahead of the DPPA mission.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">DPPA, together with the Group will:&nbsp;<br>- Re-Convene this meeting, and invite other agencies and offices, as needed, initially every 2 weeks.&nbsp;<br>- Engage with the Government to ensure OHCHR\u00b4s presence in Venezuela.&nbsp;<br>- Coordinate UN missions to the country in a sequenced and strategic way.&nbsp;<br>- Harmonize communication efforts and organize a noon briefing session with the RC.&nbsp;<br>- Advocate for continued humanitarian access.&nbsp;<br>- Explore engagement with IFIs.&nbsp;<br></p>",

Founded in the 1960s, the ELN has expanded its military, economic, and territorial control in recent years following the collapse of peace talks.&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A recent call between Petro and Trump marks a shift in their previously tense relationship and positions Washington as a key ally in Colombia\u2019s renewed offensive. While neither government has detailed how cooperation will unfold, analysts suggest it could evolve into a tripartite strategy involving the United States and Venezuela, aimed at containing a group deeply entrenched in eastern Colombia and across the Venezuelan border.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Petro has reinforced his hard-line stance, declaring on X that \u201cdrug traffickers must be disarmed,\u201d and calling for regional unity against destabilizing actors. In the same X post, Petro also urged Venezuela\u2019s interim president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, to work jointly toward that goal.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">Conflict analyst Jorge Mantilla says the government\u2019s announcements open a significant window of opportunity, despite the ELN\u2019s growing sophistication, including the use of drones, thermal sensors, and an expanded urban presence. According to Mantilla, the group\u2019s worst-case scenario would be a rapid political transition in Venezuela that seriously targets armed groups\u2014though no such shift appears imminent.&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ELN has operated in Venezuela for years, forging ties with local authorities and security forces and acting as a de facto authority in several regions, complicating any effort by the Chavista leadership to dismantle it. InSight Crime co-director Jeremy McDermott outlines three possible scenarios: no change in the ELN\u2019s status, symbolic measures under U.S. pressure, or\u2014least likely\u2014meaningful action to expel the group from Venezuelan territory.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Armed groups appear increasingly alarmed by U.S. involvement. In a recent video, FARC dissident leader Iv\u00e1n Mordisco called for a criminal alliance, including the ELN, to confront what he described as U.S. \u201cimperialist aggression\u201d in Venezuela.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Experts agree that peace talks with the ELN are effectively over: Petro\u2019s \u201ctotal peace\u201d strategy has steadily eroded, and with his term nearing its end, the president appears focused on restoring ties with Washington to avoid future judicial or financial repercussions once out of office.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clashes between the ELN guerrilla group and FARC dissidents\u2014already responsible for more than 85,000 displaced people\u2014have flared up again during the holidays and has not fully subsidised in 2026. \u201cThe 33rd Front of the Calarc\u00e1 dissidents\u2014currently in peace talks with the government\u2014as well as the ELN, continue to dispute territory without any regard for the civilian population,\u201d said Colombia\u2019s Ombudsman.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p></p>",

Until 2022, exports averaged around 700,000 to 800,000 barrels per day. \u201cThen it rose to around 1.5 million in 2025.\u201d</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>",

  "entry": "<p><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">Chadian President Mahamat Idriss D\u00e9by Itno has been named the winner of the 2026 African Peace Prize for his peaceful management of Chad's political transition and the country's humanitarian response to Sudanese refugees, the African Conference for Peace has announced.</mark> The Prize Committee's unanimous decision recognizes President D\u00e9by\u2019s role in consolidating peace in Chad while opening the country's eastern border to hundreds of thousands of people fleeing conflict in Sudan, the organization said. The committee met at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, under the auspices of the UN-mandated University for Peace (UPEACE), and was chaired by Dr. David Fern\u00e1ndez Puyana and attended by Cheikh Al-Mahfoudh Bin Bayyah, along with legal experts, human rights defenders, and international diplomats. In a statement, the committee said its decision followed an in-depth review of nominations and analytical reports by African and international research centers, highlighting President D\u00e9by's efforts to strengthen national unity and use dialogue as a strategic tool for resolving political and regional disputes. Since coming to power, D\u00e9by has sought to reconcile different political and social groups in Chad, promote national reconciliation and combat extremism and cross-border crime, with the committee noting that he steered a sensitive political transition without the country descending into violence. On the humanitarian front, reports from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and aid organizations in eastern Chad have praised the government's decision to keep borders open to Sudanese refugees, after President D\u00e9by ordered the unconditional opening of border crossings and the creation of humanitarian corridors in areas including Adr\u00e9, Tin\u00e9, Kornoy, Um Dukhun, Wadi Hawar and Amdjarass, and urged local communities to host the displaced. Data cited by the committee indicate that between 40% and 45% of the refugees have been absorbed into host communities, with villages in eastern Chad sharing homes, wells and schools without compensation\u2014solidarity that led the United Nations to describe Chad as \"a rare model of African generosity toward refugees despite limited resources,\" crediting the rapid border opening and flexible stance with helping to save hundreds of thousands of lives. The committee said the award aligns with the mission of the African Peace Prize, which honors leaders who embody high human values, spread a culture of peace, strengthen security and support sustainable development, in line with the African Union's Agenda 2063, \"The Africa We Want.\" Previous laureates include Niger's President Mohamed Bazoum (2022), Nigeria's then-President Muhammadu Buhari (2023), Gambian President Adama Barrow (2024) and Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara (2025). [\u2026] The award ceremony is scheduled for early February in Nouakchott, during the opening session of the 6th African Conference for Peace, where Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani will present the prize to President D\u00e9by.&nbsp;</p>",
  "source_url": null,
  "pu_note": "PU Note: While the award highlights genuine humanitarian contributions and aligns with the African Union\u2019s stability goals, it faces criticism for irony given persistent allegations \u2013 supported by UN reports and analysts \u2013 that D\u00e9by's government has allowed UAE arms shipments through Chad to the RSF, potentially prolonging the conflict driving the refugee crisis. Initial reactions to the announcement on X include mockery of the prize\u2019s legitimacy and accusations of hypocrisy. Overall, the award has limited significance beyond symbolic recognition of refugee hosting, undermined by unresolved controversies over Chad\u2019s role in the Sudan war. \n",

It also gives the GNU greater economic leverage, boosts its international legitimacy, and anchors European and Qatari strategic interests in Libya\u2019s Mediterranean trade corridor at a time when control over ports directly translates into political power, regional influence, and leverage over migration, energy, and security dynamics.

Military sources told Sudan Tribune that a large RSF force launched a surprise attack on army positions along the Omdurman-Bara export road. Fierce fighting occurred in the Wadi al-Hout area, west of Rahid al-Nuba in the Jabrat al-Sheikh locality, where the army reportedly repelled the attack and inflicted heavy losses. Both sides utilized heavy artillery and drones during the engagement, according to sources. The RSF is pushing to control the entire export road to the outskirts of Omdurman. While the RSF currently holds the majority of the route, with a heavy presence in Jabrat al-Sheikh and Bara, the army controls sections extending from western Omdurman through Um Qirfa and Rahid al-Nuba. In a separate development, a spokesperson for the RSF-led Sudan Constituent Alliance accused armed groups allied with the army of attacking civilians in several Kordofan villages between January 15 and 17. The alliance claimed the attacks in villages, including Alouba, Um Qalib, Debiker, and Al-Adiya Qar\u2019an, resulted in the deaths of 220 herders and the detention of many others. The spokesperson added that 912 people are currently reported missing following the violence.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">The Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) warned on Sunday of an imminent siege by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the city of El Obeid, as satellite imagery revealed significant defensive preparations and a mounting humanitarian crisis</mark>. While El Obeid faces a renewed threat of blockade, researchers reported that the cities of Kadugli and Dilling in the Nuba Mountains of South Kordofan are already under siege by an alliance between the RSF and the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Movement-North led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu. Analysts at the lab identified newly created earthen walls, or berms, along key exit points from the city and around critical infrastructure. This military activity is consistent with forces engaged in preparations for siege warfare, although the lab withheld specific locations due to human security risks. The report highlighted a trend likely to shape this phase of the conflict, characterized by an emphasis on aerial bombardment and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) targeting civilian areas and vital facilities. Satellite imagery captured between January 2 and 14 corroborated damage to El Obeid\u2019s power generation station consistent with bombardment. Open-source reports indicated that RSF drones struck the facility in the early hours of January 4, resulting in a shutdown of the electrical grid. The human toll has escalated in eastern El Obeid, where imagery from the same period confirmed damage to multiple buildings in the Al-Jallabiya neighbourhood. These findings align with local reports of RSF drone strikes on January 6 that allegedly killed at least 10 people, including eight members of a single family. The conflict has also triggered a surge in displacement. Researchers identified an increase of nearly 800 temporary structures at an internal displacement (IDP) camp in north-central El Obeid during the first half of January. These shelters included small blue tents, larger white tents, and white-toned tents with dark roof markings. Ground photographs have shown that many of these tents bear the insignia of Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre. El Obeid remains a primary transit point for those fleeing violence further south, particularly as more people escape attacks in Dilling and Kadugli. Evidence of the rising death toll was visible at local cemeteries. Satellite imagery at the Zindi Cemetery showed approximately 60 new burial mounds and ongoing burial activity. At the Daleel Cemetery, analysts identified roughly 40 new burial mounds and observed people gathered around excavated holes in images from both January 2 and 14. The Kordofan region remains highly contested, with El Obeid currently under the control of the SAF but increasingly isolated by RSF positioning.&nbsp;</p>",

  "headline": "Myanmar Military Secures Enough Votes to Form New Government (The Irawaddy, 14 January) ",
  "date": "2026-01-15 12:11:00",
  "entry": "<p>Myanmar\u2019s military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) has already secured enough seats to form a government together with military appointees, ahead of the third and final phase of the junta-held election. The outcome marks the USDP\u2019s pending return to power after its rigged election victory in 2010. The Union Election Commission (UEC) split the polls into three stages running from December 28 to January 25, citing instability. The vote has been widely condemned at home and abroad as a brazen bid to entrench rule by the generals five years after their 2021 coup. By the end of phase two, the USDP had amassed enough advance ballots alongside constitutionally reserved military seats to form a new government. A party needs to secure 50 percent of the reduced 588 seats in the national legislature in order to form a government. The USDP won 194 seats in the first two election phases. Combined with the military\u2019s quota of 166 seats, the party now controls more than 360 seats\u2014well above the 294-majority required to govern. The threshold was lowered after the junta called off elections in dozens of townships where it has lost control, cutting the Union Parliament from 664 members to 588. However, the military retained its quota and, with the USDP seats, has now achieved the threshold to entrench its rule.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><u>Results Under Fire</u>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the first-phase vote held across 102 townships, the USDP won 124 seats\u2014103 in the Lower House and 21 in the Upper House. Advance ballots reportedly accounted for 77 percent of the gains. Opposition complaints of a lack of transparency in advance voting were shrugged off by the junta-appointed Union Election Commission (UEC). The UEC has yet to announce the Phase Two results, but USDP officials said the party has won another 70 seats, bringing its total to 194. With the military\u2019s 166 seat-quota, the bloc has secured a governing majority before a single vote is cast in Phase 3 on January 25.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><u>Overall Picture</u>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The ongoing election comes five years after the military scrapped the results of the 2020 vote, arrested President U Win Myint and State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and dissolved the elected National League for Democracy (NLD). With the NLD barred, the polls mark a USDP return after more than a decade of landslide NLD victories since the transition to civilian rule in 2012. The USDP last ruled in 2010 under General Thein Sein, after the NLD boycotted the election. The Thein Sein administration packed ministries with retired military officers while appointing ethnic Shan physician Dr. Sai Mauk Kham as a civilian figurehead in the role of vice president. Analysts forecast a return to \u201cmilitary ministers in civilian clothing\u201d after Parliament convenes in March to appoint a new government expected by April. A path has also been cleared for coup leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing to retain power in civilian clothing. The new president will be chosen from three vice presidents elected respectively by the Lower House, Upper House, and military appointees. Pro\u2011military media and USDP figures have already begun lobbying for Min Aung Hlaing, and the junta boss has not ruled out the possibility. Myanmar now sits poised for a return to military rule in civilian guise, as USDP veterans and regime loyalists prepare to take control of the country\u2019s political future.&nbsp;</p><img class=\"editor-image rounded cursor-pointer\" draggable=\"true\" contenteditable=\"false\" src=\"image-ref://img-0\" alt=\"A chart of the seat of the seat of the united states\n\nAI-generated content may be incorrect.\" width=\"462\" height=\"462\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>",

  "pu_note": "PU Note: The announcement that the military-backed USDP has secured enough seats to form a government, even before the final phase of the election concludes on 25 January, stems from a highly controversial multi-phase voting process orchestrated by the junta's Union Election Commission (UEC). The polls, divided into three stages starting 28 December, were held amid widespread instability, with voting limited to select townships and canceled in others due to ongoing conflict. By the end of the second phase on January 11, the USDP claimed victories in approximately 87 out of 100 contested seats in that round, building on an earlier sweep of 88-90 seats in the first phase. Combined with the military\u2019s constitutionally reserved 25% of parliamentary seats (166 out of 664 total in both houses), this gives the USDP and its allies a clear majority (potentially over 330 seats in the lower house alone) ensuring control over government formation.  This outcome echoes the USDP's rigged win in the 2010 election, marking a potential return to a quasi-civilian facade for military dominance five years after the 2021 coup that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD).

  "entry": "<p><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">Washington has not asked Mexico City to cut crude supplies to the island, Energy Secretary Chris Wright says.&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Donald Trump wants to bring countries across the Western Hemisphere under control like domino pieces on a geopolitical board. After Venezuela, he has turned his attention to Cuba. Warnings issued over the weekend by the Republican president, \u201cNegotiate and reach agreements with the United States before it is too late,\u201d have unsettled the island, which is struggling after the oil embargo imposed on Venezuela, its main source of fuel. Trump\u2019s threats on the social network Truth have heightened anxiety in Havana. Cuba survived for many years thanks to Venezuelan oil and money. \u201cTHERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY FOR CUBA! ZERO!\u201d the U.S. president wrote on Sunday.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Trump administration, however, does not appear willing to suffocate Cuba for now. The White House occupant\u2019s statements seem more like a negotiating threat than a concrete warning. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said that the United States has not asked Mexico to cut oil supplies to the island, according to CBS. Wright made the comment after cameras stopped rolling following an interview on Sunday on Face the Nation with journalist Margaret Brennan.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Cuba depends on imported oil and fuel supplied mainly by Venezuela and Mexico to keep its power generators and vehicles running. Venezuela has been the main source of crude for Havana, exporting about 26,500 barrels per day last year, according to data compiled by Reuters.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When Washington moved against Venezuela to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, one of the conditions imposed on the new acting president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, was full control of the oil industry. The U.S. military maintains a blockade around the country and, in recent weeks, has intercepted five tankers attempting to evade sanctions. No oil leaves Venezuela without authorization from the Trump administration. To underscore the point, the president convened the world\u2019s largest oil companies, most of them American, last Friday to divide up the Venezuelan crude market.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As U.S. pressure on Venezuela has escalated and the military blockade has tightened since late September, Mexico has emerged as an alternative supplier for the island. Although the volumes are not yet significant, they are essential to preventing Cuba\u2019s collapse. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has described the oil as \u201chumanitarian aid.\u201d Mexico has been sending oil tankers to Cuba for several years. Since 2024, and following Hurricane Rafael\u2019s passage over the island, shipments have been constant. Sheinbaum has acknowledged that while a large portion of the hydrocarbon cargoes are for humanitarian purposes, some are the result of contracts between Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (Pemex) and the Cuban regime. Both the president and Pemex have avoided providing specific details on the shipments, their contents, or their cost.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sheinbaum has insisted that sending oil to the island is \u201clegal\u201d and part of the historic bilateral relationship with Havana. In recent weeks, at least three vessels have departed from the port of Coatzacoalcos, in Veracruz state, bound for Cuba, each carrying an estimated 80,000 barrels. \u201cNo more oil is being sent than has historically been sent,\u201d the Mexican president has said. Pemex has reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that since July 2023 it has been shipping various hydrocarbons to the island through its subsidiary Gasolinas del Bienestar. In its latest filing, the state oil company estimated that under this model Mexico exported 17,200 barrels of crude per day in the first nine months of 2025, representing 3.3% of its total exports.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">The Mexican president held a phone call with Trump on Monday. After the exchange, Sheinbaum told the Mexican press that oil shipments to Cuba were not part of the conversation. </mark>She nevertheless suggested her willingness to act as \u201ca channel of communication\u201d between Havana and Washington. The Mexico\u2013Cuba relationship, as well as the recent oil shipments, have also raised eyebrows among Republican lawmakers from the Cuban diaspora, who have accused Sheinbaum of \u201csupporting the Cuban dictatorship\u201d and being \u201cits accomplice.\u201d Some have even called on the Trump administration to condition the review of the USMCA free trade agreement, scheduled for July, on a complete halt to Mexican crude exports to the island.&nbsp;</p>",

The Republican\u2019s surprise announcement comes one day before the Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mar\u00eda Corina Machado is to be received in person at the White House.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cWe had an excellent conversation today, and she\u2019s a terrific person,\u201d Trump said of Rodr\u00edguez, without mentioning her by name, to reporters gathered in the Oval Office. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve worked very well with her.

In a brief declaration, she said that \u201cVenezuela is opening itself to a new political moment that allows for understanding from divergence and from political and ideological diversity.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The acting president also reported on the release of detainees, which she said had benefited 406 people. She sought to dissociate those releases from U.S. intervention, stating that they had begun last December and had been ordered by Maduro himself.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cIn December 2025, a process of releasing people deprived of liberty was initiated in order to open spaces for understanding, for coexistence, for tolerance,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said from the Miraflores Palace. \u201cThat process remains open and is precisely what we have been coordinating with the justice system in Venezuela.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">At that time, Rodr\u00edguez did not mention any call with Trump, but she did refer to a meeting with her brother, parliamentary speaker Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. The three senior Chavista figures appeared together before the cameras, evidence that all three remain in charge, after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured and taken to New York 11 days earlier.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The call with Maduro\u2019s trusted confidant and the imminent meeting with the Venezuelan opposition leader clearly illustrate the dual strategy Trump is pursuing.

Rasmussen said there remains a \u201cfundamental disagreement\u201d with the United States and emphasized that any demands violating Danish or Greenlandic sovereignty are \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d <strong>He further stated that President Trump continues to express a wish to \u201cconquer\u201d Greenland</strong>, a stance that Denmark and Greenland made clear was not in the interest of the Kingdom (14 Jan 2026, Politico).&nbsp;<br><strong>Despite the failure to shift U.S. policy, the parties agreed to establish high-level working groups to explore possible paths forward</strong>, although Rasmussen expressed uncertainty about whether these mechanisms would produce results (14 Jan 2026, Politico). Danish officials also criticized what they described as inaccurate U.S. claims regarding the security environment in Greenland, including assertions that Russian and Chinese warships are routinely present in the Arctic. <strong>Rasmussen stated that there has not been a Chinese warship in the Arctic for a decade</strong> and argued that threatening rhetoric undermines constructive dialogue (14 Jan 2026, Politico).&nbsp;<br><strong>The dispute has taken on a pronounced military and alliance dimension. </strong>Rasmussen disclosed that Denmark has contributed approximately <strong>$15 billion to Arctic security over the past two years</strong> and has pressed the United States and other NATO allies to increase their engagement through the alliance (14 Jan 2026, Politico). <strong>Denmark also announced plans to strengthen its own security presence in Greenland</strong>, underscoring Copenhagen\u2019s intent to reinforce sovereignty and deterrence amid escalating U.S. pressure (14 Jan 2026, Politico). <strong>On the same day, President Trump publicly linked his demand for control of Greenland to the proposed U.S. \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense project</strong>, asserting that NATO should facilitate U.S. acquisition of the territory and warning that Russia or China would otherwise do so (14 Jan 2026, Politico).&nbsp;<br>European allies have responded by signaling concrete military support for Denmark. <strong>Germany and France stated they would send military personnel to Greenland</strong>, while Sweden and Norway separately announced similar deployments (14 Jan 2026, Reuters). <strong>Germany confirmed that a 13-member reconnaissance team would deploy from Thursday to Saturday to assess conditions and explore potential military contributions</strong> to support Denmark in ensuring regional security, including possible maritime surveillance roles (14 Jan 2026, Reuters). The German government emphasized that the mission was undertaken at Denmark\u2019s request and in coordination with other European partners.&nbsp;<br><strong>These European deployments reflect growing concern within Europe about the implications of U.S. rhetoric and the stability of transatlantic relations. President Trump has repeatedly asserted that Greenland is strategically vital to U.S. security and has stated that all options remain on the table to secure the territory</strong>, language that European officials say has severely strained relations between the United States and its allies (14 Jan 2026, Reuters). Denmark and Greenland, while seeking continued dialogue, have publicly reinforced that sovereignty is non-negotiable and that security concerns should be addressed through alliance cooperation rather than territorial acquisition (14 Jan 2026, Politico).&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Trump Pursues Greenland Amid \"Fundamental Disagreement\" with Denmark and Greenland </strong>(NYT/Politico/The Hill, Jan 14)&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">President Trump continues his campaign to acquire Greenland despite unified rejection from Danish and Greenlandic officials, who met with top US administration officials Wednesday to address what Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen called a \"fundamental disagreement\" over the Arctic territory's future.&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">Greenland's significance extends far beyond territorial ambitions. The island is losing ice rapidly as the Arctic warms at least twice as fast as the rest of the planet due to fossil fuel emissions. In the 12 months ending August 31, 2025, Greenland lost 105 billion metric tons of ice, contributing to global sea-level rise that has increased by four inches since 1993.&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Climate change is opening new Arctic shipping routes, particularly China's \"Polar Silk Road\" through Russia's northern coast, and providing access to critical minerals including graphite, zinc, and rare earths essential for renewable energy technologies. \"His fixation on Greenland is an admission that climate change is real,\" said John Conger, a former Pentagon official now advising the Center for Climate and Security.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Diplomatic Tensions and Local Opposition</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">The meeting between Rasmussen, Greenland Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt, Vice President JD Vance, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio marked the first senior-level engagement since Trump revived his territorial ambitions. The parties agreed to establish a working group, expected to meet within weeks, to address American security concerns while respecting Denmark's territorial integrity and Greenland's self-determination.&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">\"The discussions focused on how to ensure the long-term security in Greenland, and here our perspectives continue to differ,\" Rasmussen stated, emphasizing it is \"absolutely not necessary\" for the US to own Greenland.&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trump's aggressive rhetoric has backfired locally. Nearly a dozen Greenlanders interviewed in Nuuk expressed growing resentment toward his approach. \"We cannot be bought. That is not something we want to be a part of,\" said Nuuk Mayor Avaaraq S. Olsen. The Greenland Dog Sledding Association revoked an invitation to Trump's Greenland envoy after the president's dismissive joke about Denmark's contribution being \"one more dogsled.\"&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Trump's Strategy and Regional Realities</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to sources familiar with Trump's thinking, his preferred strategy involves incentivizing a referendum for Greenland to align with the US through information campaigns and financial inducements. However, Trump's public statements\u2014including that owning Greenland is important for \"psychological\" reasons and refusing to rule out military force\u2014have hardened opposition. A 2025 poll showed 85% of Greenlanders opposed leaving Denmark to align with the US.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen declared: \"If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark. We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark.\"&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rasmussen challenged Trump's security narrative, noting that according to Danish intelligence, no Chinese warship has been in Greenland for roughly a decade. Independent researchers support this assessment, with Arctic Institute senior fellow Gabriella Gricius calling claims about Russian and Chinese ships circling the island \"just not true.\"&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Denmark announced increased military presence around Greenland, with Swedish and other European soldiers arriving at Denmark's request. Meanwhile, bipartisan US lawmakers have expressed opposition to any use of military force against the NATO ally, with Senator Rand Paul calling Trump's approach counterproductive despite agreeing on Greenland's strategic importance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>",

  "entry": "<p>Vladimir Putin's geopolitical worldview was shaped by a pivotal 1989 phone call. As protesters approached the KGB villa in Dresden during the Berlin Wall's collapse, Putin requested Soviet reinforcements. \"Moscow is silent,\" came the reply. The Kremlin's refusal to deploy troops\u2014a \"paralysis of power\"\u2014allowed the Soviet empire to crumble, leaving Putin humiliated and enraged.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Putin has spent his career overcoming this humiliation. Yet over the past year, as allies have been ousted or bombed\u2014often by the US\u2014Putin has been curiously silent himself.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A Pattern of Restraint</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">Russia's reactions to recent US actions reveal calculated restraint. When the US conducted military operations in Venezuela on January 2-3, 2026\u2014including airstrikes and seizing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2014Moscow's response was notably muted. The Foreign Ministry issued routine condemnations, while Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov expressed support for Venezuela's new president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez. UN Representative Vasily Nebenzya used standard anti-Western rhetoric about \"neocolonialism and imperialism.\"&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">Security Council Chairman Dmitry Medvedev provided inflammatory commentary\u2014accusing Trump of violating international law while praising him for protecting US interests\u2014fulfilling his typical role of making extreme statements to shift the Overton Window. Significantly, Putin and official Kremlin spokespersons remained completely silent.&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Precedents and Constraints</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">This pattern mirrors Russia's response to US-Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June 2025. Moscow issued boilerplate condemnations but provided no material support. Similarly, when jihadist militias overthrew Kremlin-backed Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad, Russia offered only rhetorical outrage.&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Russia's hands are full with Ukraine. Putin's invasion, entering its fifth year, represents Moscow's deadliest and costliest conflict since World War II, draining manpower, attention, and resources. Unlike the Soviet bloc maintained for four decades, today's Russian alliances with Iran, Syria, and Venezuela are looser and more opportunistic.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While Putin suffers immense pressure to preserve control over Ukraine\u2014a core interest\u2014there's less reason risking direct conflict with the US or important partners like Israel and Arab states over more distant allies. Washington remains the key player in Ukraine negotiations where Putin hopes Trump will endorse his maximalist territorial and demilitarization demands.&nbsp;</p>",

  "pu_note": "Netanyahu released an unusually pointed statement objecting to the \"executive board\" for Gaza, which the White House named on Friday. The committee, which reports to the Trump-led Board of Peace, includes the foreign minister of Turkey and a senior Qatari official, despite Netanyahu's insistence that those countries have no role in governing Gaza. The announcement stunned Netanyahu, who was not consulted. The Israeli media quickly started reporting on the idea that Qatar and Turkey \u2014 key mediators on the Gaza deal who both have fractious relationships with Israel \u2014 would be wielding influence. \"The announcement... was not coordinated with Israel and runs counter to its policy. The Prime Minister instructed the Foreign Minister to raise this matter with the U.S. Secretary of State,\" Netanyahu said. \n\n \n\nThe other side: Asked by Axios about Netanyahu's comment, the senior U.S. official doubled down. \n\n The official said Netanyahu was not consulted on the membership of the committee because he does not have a say in the matter. \"If he wants us to deal with Gaza, it will have to be our way. We worked over him. Let him focus on Iran and let us deal with Gaza. We are not going to argue with him. He will do his politics and we will keep moving forward with our plan. He can't really go against us,\" the U.S. official said. The senior official added that unless Netanyahu wants to send Israeli troops back into the fight in Gaza, with the U.S. withdrawing from this issue, he'll have to get with the U.S. program. \"We are doing him a favor. If this fails he can say, 'I told you so.' We know that if it succeeds he will claim credit.\" \n\n \n\nBetween the lines: While Trump personally has kept up a close relationship with Netanyahu, many on his team are fed up with the Israeli prime minister's hardline stances in Gaza and beyond. They're also worried that if they can't build momentum behind phase two of the deal, Israel will resume the war. \n\nThe U.S. official claimed that while Netanyahu is highly skeptical the U.S. plan would work, he likes its content. The official said that \"nobody in Israel believed we will get this far - but we managed to do it.\" ",

The future Costa Rican prison, which will cost 35 million dollars, will have five modules with a total capacity of 5,100 inmates and, according to the government, will be used to hold the most violent prisoners.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The project comes at a time when Costa Rica is registering historic homicide figures: around 900 per year, of which authorities attribute 70% to drug trafficking. Last December, Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves visited El Salvador, where he met with Bukele and toured the CECOT.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Bukele had already visited Costa Rica on November 12, 2024, and toured the country\u2019s main prison, known as La Reforma.

The message was later used by the ruling party\u2019s candidate, Laura Fern\u00e1ndez, in her campaign. \u201cIf the next administration gives continuity to the projects of this government, I have no doubt that Costa Rica\u2019s best days are ahead, a safer and more prosperous Costa Rica,\u201d Bukele said in that video.&nbsp;</p>",

T</strong>here is visible criticism of Henrique Capriles on X from within opposition circles (or anti-regime users) in recent days (since January 3-7, 2026). These critics often accuse him of being too conciliatory (e.g., favoring dialogue, negotiation, and avoiding confrontation), compromising with the regime (historical references to past elections or dialogues), or outright betraying the opposition cause by not fully endorsing the U.S. action against Maduro.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In a television interview on Monday, opposition notable Mar\u00eda Corina Machado stated her intent to return to Venezuela \u201cas soon as possible\u201d and declaring her movement ready to win a free election.

In Venezuela, most opposition officials have been sidelined for months by government repression, operating in hiding or in prison. All demand security guarantees for a return home, a task they entrust to the United States. If the opposition leadership's first reaction was their willingness to immediately replace Chavista officials, the reality check imposed by the Republican president's choice of Delcy Rodr\u00edguez ended up redefining their strategy. <strong>The priority is no longer assuming power, but returning to Venezuela.

  "pu_note": "PU Note: The domestic reactions appear highly polarized and emotionally charged. Rodr\u00edguez calling for national mourning reinforces the government's narrative that Venezuela suffered an illegitimate act of war by the U.S. and projects institutional control, likely continue rallying and encourage loyalists around national grievance. \n\n \n\nWhile the opposition and leaders are likely to continue gaining support from Trump, he has, however, been told by the CIA that Rodriguez and other senior officials from Maduro's government are the best bet to maintain stability, sources said. The classified assessment was one reason why Trump decided to back Rodriguez instead of opposition leader Machado, the sources said. Trump appears to be encouraging Maduro loyalists to collaborate with Rodr\u00edguez, potentially trying to contain internal cohesion and reaction after the outcry from capturing Maduro instead of signaling support for Trump-aligned Venezuelan opposition. His approach suggests a preference for stability through regime insiders, not the opposition, which strengthens conditions to enact the oil partnerships he is seeking. \n\n \n\nThis creates mixed messages to Venezuelans: the U.S. removed Maduro but is not yet supporting a clear opposition-led transition. Rodr\u00edguez's position is stronger than it looks\u2014because the U.S. is treating her as an operational partner. Her reassertion of institutional control, indicates chavista structures remain operational despite Maduro's capture. ",

  "date": "2026-01-13 09:45:00",
  "entry": "<p>Differences between the reported numbers of released detainees stem from the complexity of a process involving judges, prosecutors, and prison authorities.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After several days of piecemeal releases, the Venezuelan government announced on Monday that it has freed 116 prisoners, a gesture through which chavismo seeks to send a message of openness. The figures, however, remain confusing. Human rights organizations have so far only been able to confirm the release of 49 people, including 24 freed during the early hours of Monday and the remainder who have been released since last Thursday, when the government announced the liberation of \u201ca significant number\u201d of detainees. According to sources familiar with the process, the discrepancy between the figures is explained by the complexity of the procedures that must be coordinated among judges, prosecutors, and prison authorities before a release is carried out.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This first official figure would represent the most significant act of clemency in a Venezuela without Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a process that still generates many doubts among humanitarian organizations but also a degree of optimism. According to a source involved in the negotiations, this is a historic moment in the release of prisoners in Venezuela. The country\u2019s prisons still hold between 800 and 1,000 political prisoners, according to organizations that monitor their highly contested judicial proceedings.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Negotiations to secure their release are taking place on multiple fronts, with each country exerting its own pressure. These are complex talks, and although several mediators attribute to Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, the acting president, a willingness to cooperate, she herself faces internal resistance. \u201cThere are disagreements within the regime,\u201d says a diplomatic source who has maintained dialogue with Caracas for years. \u201cSome do not want to give ground, while Delcy Rodr\u00edguez does,\u201d the source adds. \u201cShe has always been in favor of this process,\u201d says another interlocutor about the leader, who, on the other hand, has overseen the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN), an agency responsible for a large share of arbitrary detentions.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Negotiations over the release of political prisoners have been a constant over the past decade, but the capture of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by U.S. special forces on January 3 has opened a new and unpredictable scenario. Contrary to many forecasts, chavismo has remained standing, and Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has assumed control of the country, backed by President Donald Trump. Several interlocutors in contact with Caracas who spoke to <em>El Pa\u00eds</em> in recent days attribute to the new president a greater willingness to loosen the hardline approach that characterized madurismo, while acknowledging internal resistance within the core of power.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The main declared objective of the United States, after removing Maduro and his wife Cilia from the country, is for U.S. companies to be able to exploit Venezuelan oil. But Washington, judging by the words of Trump and his associates, is also exerting pressure for the regime to show signs of openness, through measures such as the release of prisoners. In this context, National Assembly president Jorge Rodr\u00edguez announced last Thursday the release of \u201ca significant number\u201d of detainees, without specifying figures, presenting it as \u201ca unilateral gesture to strengthen peace.\u201d He also thanked Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, former Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, and Qatar for their mediation, a message aimed at distancing the process from Washington\u2019s shadow.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The announcement raised expectations among the nearly 1,000 families with relatives imprisoned for political reasons. Although the confirmed figures remain modest, Trump celebrated last Saturday: \u201cVenezuela has started the process, in a big way, of freeing its political prisoners. Thank you! I hope those prisoners remember how lucky they were that the U.S. came in and did what had to be done,\u201d he wrote on his social network. If they do not, he warned, \u201cit will not be good for them.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The releases are proceeding slowly and in stages. At Christmas and New Year, the government announced similar measures for another 187 detainees that never fully materialized. The legal procedure remains unclear: courts should issue release orders and prison directors should immediately open the gates, but in several cases detainees do not leave even with those documents in hand. The opacity surrounding the figures and the gap between official announcements and reality has become a constant of chavismo in moments of high political pressure. Meanwhile, arbitrary detentions have not ceased.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Alfredo Romero, director of Foro Penal, is skeptical. In his view, this process \u201cresembles previous ones that have occurred since 2016\u201d and does not represent structural change. \u201cThese are negotiations to make gestures to public opinion. In each process, they never release the number they announce, because they include people who are not political prisoners; that is why they do not give names, only numbers,\u201d he says. \u201cAlways, after each process, new people are jailed, cells are emptied and then filled again. And the repressive system continues and is not dismantled.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In recent years, especially during 2025, releases have focused on foreign nationals as part of negotiations with the United States and other countries. Foro Penal describes many of these cases as \u201cforeign hostages\u201d: people who are not activists or political prisoners but whom the government uses as diplomatic bargaining chips, as occurred in previous exchanges linked to Alex Saab or to the nephews of Maduro and Cilia Flores, who were handed over by Washington in various negotiations in exchange for U.S. citizens h</p>",

Deportations of people with pending criminal charges rose from 750 to 2,700 monthly.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The shift partly reflects Trump's revocation of temporary legal status for millions who entered legally under Biden policies.

The convoy of troops, armored vehicles, and logistics trucks departed the capital Juba on Saturday evening. </mark>The deployment is primarily defensive and aimed at stabilizing the security perimeter around Bor rather than launching an immediate counter-offensive against the Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA-IO), a senior security source told Sudans Post. \u201cThe reinforcement is not for an offensive operation,\u201d said the source, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the operation. \u201cThe priority is to defend Bor and stabilize the situation. At the same time, a much larger force is being prepared to eventually clear the entire state of rebel presence.\u201d Witnesses in Gumbo Shirkat, a neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of Juba along the main highway, described a heavy military presence moving north. Residents reported a mix of troop carriers and armored vehicles, noting the scale of the movement was \u201cunusual for a Saturday night.\u201d \u201cWe saw many military trucks moving fast toward Bor,\u201d one resident said. \u201cThis was not a normal movement.\u201d The urgent deployment follows the capture of Pajut by SPLA-IO forces on Friday morning. The town lies along the main arterial route north of Bor and holds significant strategic value for controlling movement across central Jonglei. Its fall has raised alarm in Juba that opposition forces could utilize the position to push further south toward the state capital. The rebels captured approximately two dozen war captives during the takeover of Pajut. Among those detained were police officers and senior army officers, including personnel holding the rank of brigadier general. The South Sudan People\u2019s Defence Forces (SSPDF) have not officially confirmed the loss of the town or commented on the reported capture of its personnel and equipment. Separately, military officials confirmed that Lt. Gen. Johnson Olony Thabo, the deputy chief of defence forces for mobilisation and a prominent former rebel commander, was present in neighboring Lakes State on Friday as the security situation in Jonglei deteriorated. High-level security commanders are expected to travel to Bor in the coming days to assess the situation on the ground. The source indicated that the military leadership is launching an inquiry into the circumstances under which government forces withdrew from Pajut. \u201cThere will be an assessment on the ground \u2014 what happened, why positions collapsed and how to prevent further advances,\u201d the source said. The escalation underscores fears of a return to civil war, which ended in September 2018 with the signing of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS). Control of the strategic town of Bor shifted repeatedly during the five-year conflict. The latest clashes highlight the fragility of the security arrangements and the risk of a return to full-scale hostilities between government forces and the opposition, both signatories to the peace deal. Analysts attribute the rising tensions to the detention and ongoing trial of First Vice President Riek Machar. The opposition leader was arrested in March 2025 and has since been suspended from office pending the court\u2019s verdict.&nbsp;</p>",

  "pu_note": " \n\nPU Note: The deployment of SSPDF reinforcements to Jonglei State represents a defensive escalation following the SPLA-IO's capture of Pajut \u2013 a strategic gateway to Bor. Recent developments, including SPLA-IO\u2019s 72-hour evacuation ultimatum for civilians and aid workers in Bor and Duk, underscore the immediate threat of urban fighting. With over 180,000 already displaced and at least four health facilities looted, the humanitarian situation is critical. The 2018 Peace Agreement (R-ARCSS) is increasingly viewed as defunct by SPLM-IO forces due to the continued detention of First Vice President Riek Machar. Possible scenarios include a large-scale government counter-offensive to prevent a siege of Bor, which risks sparking full-scale hostilities across Jonglei and Upper Nile states.",

The meeting aims to close the gap created by a paradoxical cooling of relations between the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After Maduro\u2019s arrest, Trump announced a negotiated \u201ctransition\u201d with the interim president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, explicitly ruling out Machado as the right person to govern under current conditions. In this way, Trump sidelined the opposition movement with the strongest internal and external Venezuelan support from a transition whose terms remain undefined\u2014and, crucially, without territorial or institutional control at this stage.The White House has effectively moved past the results of Venezuela\u2019s disputed 2024 presidential election, which numerous international reports said was won by Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, Machado\u2019s endorsed candidate, after she was barred from running.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">While Machado enjoys enormous popular support, she lacks deep backing within the Bolivarian Armed Forces, which continue to underpin the regime.

She envisions Venezuela as a future strategic ally of the United States and has therefore avoided openly criticizing Trump\u2019s decisions on oil and natural resources, though she has expressed reservations about a transition led by Delcy Rodr\u00edguez. She has even offered to Trump her Nobel Peace Prize, though the Norweigan Peace Institute has said it cannot be \u201ctransferred to others.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

  "date": "2026-01-16 12:32:00",
  "entry": "<p>hechen President Ramzan Kadyrov has been hospitalized due to kidney failure and is reportedly undergoing dialysis, according to a report sourced from Ukraine\u2019s Defense Intelligence. While not publicly confirmed, the report follows others that the 49-year-old strongman\u2019s health has been declining in recent weeks and that Moscow is searching for a successor.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On January 5, Ramzan Kadyrov appointed his eldest son, 20-year-old Akhmat, as acting deputy prime minister. That\u2019s a rapid promotion from minister of sports and physical culture and suggests Ramzan is preparing to hand off power. Any succession between strongmen is fraught with instability and this one is a risk for both the Kadyrovs and Moscow.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Years of Questions Over Kadyrov\u2019s Health</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Novaya Gazeta Europe reported that Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s health deteriorated sharply after he arrived in Moscow on December 24 for a State Council meeting with Russian President Putin, requiring him to be rushed to the hospital.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Speculation about Kadyrov\u2019s health has grown since 2019, fueled by public absences and fluctuations in his weight. In a 2024 report, Novaya Gazeta claimed that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic necrosis in 2019. Chechen authorities have tried to quash such reports but have not released medical information about Kadyrov.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Kadyrovs Are a Deadly Dynasty</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Russia fought two vicious wars and a lingering Islamist insurgency in Chechnya in the decade following the Soviet Union\u2019s dissolution. Memories of the brutality on both sides remain vivid. Moscow finally brought Chechnya to heel by devastating it \u2014 and by co-opting elements of the insurgency under Ramzan Kadyrov\u2019s father, Akhmat.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In return for his personal fealty to Putin, Kadyrov receives outsized federal subsidies and the leeway to run Chechnya as his personal fiefdom. His rule has been marked by severe human rights abuses, including extra-judicial killings, which have led to deep but largely suppressed grievances. Kadyrov concentrates power and money in a narrow patronage network comprised of relatives and cronies, keeping a lid on rivalries between factions.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Both of Kadyrov\u2019s Sons Are too Young To Take Power</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><mark data-color=\"#FFFF00\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0); color: inherit;\">In recent years, Kadyrov has taken steps aimed at ensuring his dynastic regime. Still, his appointment of his eldest son came as a surprise. Attention had focused on his third son, 18-year-old Adam, who has taken on several official positions over the last two years, including acting as his father\u2019s head of security.&nbsp;</mark></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Media reports indicate officials in the Kremlin and the Federal Security Service (FSB) favor alternative candidates, notably Apti Alaudinov, commander of\u202fthe \u201cAkhmat\u201d unit, and Adam Delimkhanov, one of Kadyrov\u2019s closest allies. And assuming the minimum age requirement for the job remains in place, a placeholder would be needed if Ramzan dies or leaves office before either son reaches 30.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the Kremlin, the nightmare scenario is a breakdown in control that leads to a renewed insurgency. It would undermine Putin\u2019s origin story as the man who stopped the Russian Federation\u2019s disintegration and brought Chechnya back into the fold. It could also divert resources from other priorities, such as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Ultimately, the succession will likely be arbitrated in Moscow, hinging on the preferences of the security services and Kremlin approval as much as on local clan dynamics.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>A Potential Time Bomb for Russia That May Present an Opportunity to the West</strong>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">U.S. and Western intelligence agencies should closely monitor developments in Chechnya with an eye toward taking advantage of scenarios ranging from a smooth transfer of power to a Putin- or Kadyrov-backed successor to a prolonged and violent power struggle. If the latter occurs before the war in Ukraine ends, internal Russian chaos may create opportunities for Ukraine to exploit.&nbsp;</p>",

In lieu of a rapid attack, the United States has <strong>shifted to a strategy of building options</strong>, including <strong>expanded military planning and preparations for new sanctions targeting regime-linked officials and companies</strong> (18 Jan 2026, Israel Hayom). This recalibration places emphasis on gaining leverage while avoiding near\u2011term escalation, even as pressure on Tehran intensifies (18 Jan 2026, Israel Hayom).&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Concurrently, the <strong>US military posture in and around the Middle East has been reinforced</strong>, with the <strong>USS Abraham Lincoln and its escorts transiting the Strait of Malacca toward CENTCOM\u2019s area</strong> and <strong>additional fighter aircraft deploying to the region</strong>, including <strong>12 F\u201115s to Jordan</strong>, to <strong>provide the White House with a wide range of options</strong>(18 Jan 2026, Jerusalem Post; 18 Jan 2026, Israel Hayom). US officials framed the buildup with the statement that <strong>\u2018all options are on the table\u2019</strong>, a formulation intended to keep <strong>credible military pressure</strong> while political decisions are weighed (18 Jan 2026, Jerusalem Post). <strong>Israeli leadership engaged intensively in consultations</strong>, with <strong>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convening senior ministers</strong> to review developments (18 Jan 2026, Jerusalem Post).&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Inside Iran, the information environment has been highly constrained by a <strong>10\u2011day nationwide internet blackout</strong> (18 Jan 2026, Al Monitor; New Arab). A monitor noted <strong>only a brief, filtered restoration</strong> before services dropped again (18 Jan 2026, Al Monitor). Against this backdrop, <strong>several state television channels were hacked</strong> to broadcast anti\u2011regime messages and protest footage, providing a rare breach of official narratives (18 Jan 2026, Israel Hayom).

The <strong>judiciary signaled that some detainees could face the capital charge of \u2018moharebeh\u2019</strong> and warned that those deemed responsible for violence would <strong>\u2018not be spared\u2019</strong> (18 Jan 2026, New Arab). These statements suggest a <strong>continuation of harsh punitive measures</strong> even as authorities claim calm has been restored (18 Jan 2026, Al Monitor; New Arab).&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In the regional and political arena, <strong>President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that an attack on the Supreme Leader would constitute full\u2011scale war</strong> (18 Jan 2026, Al Monitor; New Arab). Commentary cited by Israeli media discussed the possibility that <strong>a \u2018dramatic\u2019 one\u2011time strike could target the Supreme Leader</strong>, though analysts cautioned that such an action might not produce regime change and could empower security hardliners (18 Jan 2026, Jerusalem Post). The <strong>Israeli prime minister\u2019s reported request for a delay</strong> was linked to questions of <strong>Israeli air defense and allied readiness</strong>, as well as uncertainty about the strategic efficacy of an immediate operation (18 Jan 2026, Jerusalem Post).&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Chronologically, the <strong>most intense violence in the streets appears to have occurred around 8\u20139 January</strong>, with reports that <strong>deaths surged to the thousands and protester numbers spiked sharply</strong> before the crackdown reduced visible mobilization (18 Jan 2026, Jerusalem Post; 18 Jan 2026, Al Monitor; New Arab).

  "entry": "<p>The Sandinista regime of Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo announced on Saturday that Managua would release a series of political prisoners in a gesture marking the 19th anniversary of the far-left administration, without acknowledging that the move could also amount to a concession to Washington, as the Donald Trump government embarked on a campaign to rid the hemisphere of governments accused of committing crimes against humanity.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Ortega\u2013Murillo couple framed the decision as a commitment to \u201creconciliation and peace,\u201d as dozens of detainees were freed from prison facilities. A preliminary assessment determined that between 19 and 30 of those released were in fact political prisoners, including politician \u00d3scar Gadea and evangelical pastor Rudy Palacios.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Opposition leaders argued that Managua was yielding to what they described as the \u201cMaduro factor,\u201d following the capture of the Bolivarian leader in Caracas and his transfer to New York along with his wife to stand trial, where a life sentence is widely expected.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This context, they say, explains the Ortegas\u2019 sudden decision. \u201cThere is no doubt that this is the result of political pressure and of chess moves triggered by events in Venezuela,\u201d the Uni\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica Renovadora (Unamos) said.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The U.S. State Department has long questioned the legal mandate of the Ortega\u2013Murillo regime following flawed elections in which most opposition leaders were either imprisoned or forced into exile. The Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs noted that Ortega\u2019s 2006 election should have resulted in a single five-year term, not a nearly two-decade-long dynasty.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cToday, the brutal Murillo\u2013Ortega dictatorship \u2018celebrates\u2019 19 years of what should have been a five-year democratic mandate. Nicaraguans voted for a president in 2006, not for an illegitimate dynasty for life,\u201d the State Department said in a statement, as Washington enforces its \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy toward full democratization.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Among political analysts, the prevailing question is no longer \u201cif,\u201d but rather \u201cwho\u2019s next,\u201d as attention increasingly turns toward Cuba.&nbsp;</p>",

However, following the U.S. removal of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Trump\u2019s comments about Mexico, Cuba and Greenland carried new weight.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cHe asked me my opinion about what they had done in Venezuela and I told him very clearly that our constitution is very clear, that we do not agree with interventions and that was it,\u201d Sheinbaum said.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Trump \u201cstill insisted that if we ask for it, they could help\u201d with military forces, which Sheinbaum said she again rejected. \u201cWe told him, so far it\u2019s going very well, it\u2019s not necessary, and furthermore there is Mexico\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity and he understood,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">In an interview with Fox News aired last Thursday, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ve knocked out 97% of the drugs coming in by water and we are going to start now hitting land, with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico. It\u2019s very sad to watch.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sheinbaum said Monday that the two leaders agreed to continue working together.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Mexico\u2019s Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente spoke Sunday with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Rubio asked for \u201ctangible results\u201d and greater cooperation to dismantle the cartels, according to a statement from the U.S. State Department.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sheinbaum said Mexico shared such results, including a significant drop in homicides, falling U.S. fentanyl seizures and a decrease in fentanyl overdose deaths.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Experts consider direct U.S. intervention in Mexico unlikely, given Mexico\u2019s cooperation and its importance as an economic partner, but expect Trump to continue using such rhetoric to maintain pressure on Mexico to intensify its efforts.&nbsp;</p>",

  "pu_note": "The European Union released this statement today: \u201cThe EU expresses its concern regarding the recent decree and the statements by President Xiomara Castro and the president of the Congress, calling for a recount of the 2025 general election held on 30 November 2025. The EU reiterates its support for the work of the Honduran electoral institutions and the official proclamation of results by the National Electoral Council, which recognised Nasry Asfura as the country\u2019s legitimate president-elect and confirmed the final results for the National Congress and municipal elections. The EU condemns the acts of violence carried out against political actors in recent days and calls on all actors to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition of power. The will of the Honduran people, clearly expressed through the electoral process, must be respected. We look forward to working with President Asfura and his administration.\" \n\nThe EU statement strengthens international support for the National Electoral Council\u2019s results and further weakens President Xiomara Castro\u2019s call for a recount. By recognizing Asfura as the legitimate president-elect and expressing willingness to work with his administration, the EU signals that contesting the election results is unlikely to gain international backing, echoing Washington\u2019s position and raising the political cost for Castro and her allies.
